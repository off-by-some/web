# Resume

This is the codebase for my personal site—part portfolio, part engineering playground. Built with ❤️ in Svelte, and powered by a handcrafted SCSS design system.

It includes a full token compiler, dynamic theming engine, and perceptually-tuned color scales via OKLCH. Inspired by the rigor of enterprise systems but driven by curiosity.

This is where I explore what it means to build frontends that scale beautifully, adapt seamlessly, and feel right down to the pixel.
